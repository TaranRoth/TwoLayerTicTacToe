    <p>Welcome to Two-Layer Tic Tac Toe! You're going to play against the computer, which at the moment just picks a random spot to play. Here are the rules: You can take a square if it's only been captured once by your opponent, but you can't capture that square if they've taken it twice. The rest of the rules are like regular tic tac toe.</p>
